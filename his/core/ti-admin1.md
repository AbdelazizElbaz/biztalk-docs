# TI Admin
Transaction Integrator (TI) Manager provides a graphical user interface for creating, viewing, and managing the host-initiated processing (HIP) and Windows-initiated processing (WIP) environments. The user interface is accessible through the TI Manager management console and appears in tree view, property pages, and wizards. You can display Help topics on the individual user interface controls by clicking **Help** on the TI Manager wizard page or dialog box or by selecting a control or node and pressing the **F1** key. These individual Help topics are included in this section for easier reference and review.
