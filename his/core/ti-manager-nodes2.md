# TI Manager Nodes
The Transaction Integrator (TI) Manager console provides a tree view of the primary configuration elements used in host-initiated processing (HIP) and Windows-initiated processing (WIP). HIP enables an IBM mainframe program in CICS, IMS, or MVS to call a COM or .NET object. WIP enables a Windows client application to access an IBM mainframe transaction program in CICS, IMS, or MVS.  
  
 Each major element of the process is represented by a node on the tree in the left pane of the management console. Double-clicking the node expands it; right-clicking the node displays a shortcut menu.
