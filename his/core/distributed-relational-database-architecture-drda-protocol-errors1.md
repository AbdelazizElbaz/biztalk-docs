A network level syntax error has occurred.<br /><br /> <strong>Reason</strong>: The data stream syntax error reply message indicates that the server could not process a protocol command that the server determined did not conform to the requirements of the Distributed Data Management architecture.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Review a client network trace to determine if the server returned an optional severity code or other optional diagnostic information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The requested command sent a data object extension that is not recognized or is not supported by the target system.<br /><br /> <strong>Reason</strong>: The target not supported reply message indicates that the server received a parameter on an object from the client that the server does not recognize or that the server does not support.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Review a client network trace to determine if the server returned an optional severity code or other optional diagnostic information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The requested command included a parameter value that is not recognized or is not supported by the target system.<br /><br /> <strong>Reason</strong>: The parameter value not supported reply message indicates that the server received a parameter value (e.g. invalid Host CCSID) on an object from the client that the server does not recognize or that the server does not support. The client specified an incorrect user-specified value when connecting or when executing a command.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Review a client network trace to view the parameter whose value is not recognized or not supported, and to determine if the server returned an optional severity code or other optional diagnostic information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

By default, the client defines 128 package sections, allowing the client to execute 128 concurrent SQL SELECT statements per client connection. When the maximum number of outstanding concurrent SQL SELECT statements exceeds the number of pre-defined sections, then the client cannot execute a new SQL SELECT statement.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Verify connection information to ensure the Package Collection value matches DB2 collection in which Host Integration Server packages are defined for execution by current user ID or PUBLIC. For more information, see topic on Package Collection.                                                                                                                                                                             |
|         -1501          |           HY000           |          -1501           | <strong>Message</strong>: User has no authority to create (execute) package.<br /><br /> <strong>Reason</strong>: The server cannot execute a SQL SELECT or CALL statement that requires a CURSOR statement stored in a static SQL package to which the current user is not authorized. The client relies on pre-defined SQL statements in sections within DB2 Static SQL packages to support execution of SQL SELECT statements. By default, the client defines a package automatically, if the runtime user has package BIND, EXECUTE, and GRANT authority over the DB2 collection specified in the Package Collection connection property.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Verify connection information to ensure the Package Collection value matches DB2 collection in which Host Integration Server packages are defined for execution by current user identifier or PUBLIC. Manually create Host Integration Server packages for execution by current user ID or PUBLIC, using Data Access Tool, Data Source Wizard, Data Links, or Data Access Library. Connect to DB2 using an authorization ID that is privileged to automatically create Host Integration Server packages (CREATE, BIND and EXECUTE privileges).

Application reaches the limit of connections from connection pooling. Max number defined in “MAX POOL SIZE” property.<br /><br /> <strong>Reason</strong>: Client cannot connect to server when the available connections in the client connection pool have been exhausted.<br /><br /> <strong>Action</strong>: Configure a larger max pool size and set a timeout on the pooled connections. For more information, see topic on Max Pool Size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
