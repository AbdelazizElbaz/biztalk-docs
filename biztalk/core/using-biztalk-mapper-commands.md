# Using BizTalk Mapper Commands
When BizTalkMapper becomes active, it adds a menu called <strong>BizTalk</strong> to the Microsoft [!INCLUDE [btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] shell. This menu provides access to the BizTalk Mapper commands and their functionality. When BizTalk Mapper is active, the <strong>BizTalk</strong> menu provides the commands that are specific to editing BizTalk maps.  

 Where applicable, BizTalk Mapper uses existing [!INCLUDE [btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] menu items for commands that have obvious parallels to standard application functionality. For example, when BizTalk Mapper is active, the <strong>Save</strong> command on the <strong>File</strong> menu saves changes to the map that is currently being edited.  

 The following table describes the commands within BizTalk Mapper that can be used in the process of developing maps.
