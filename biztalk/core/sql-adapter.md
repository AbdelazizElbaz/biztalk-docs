# SQL Adapter
[!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] no longer supports the SQL Adapter. We recommend you use [!INCLUDE [adaptersql](../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] to achieve the same functionality.  
  
 However, [!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] supports the SQL Adapter with the components shipped with [!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], like EDI Control message SQL receive pipeline, or AS2 resend control message receive pipeline.
