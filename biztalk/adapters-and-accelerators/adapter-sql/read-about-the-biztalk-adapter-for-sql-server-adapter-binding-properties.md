# Read about the BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server adapter binding properties
The [!INCLUDE [adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties. By setting these properties, you can control some of the adapter's behavior. This section describes the binding properties exposed by the [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. It also shows how you can access them by using .NET programming or by setting properties on a [!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] physical port binding.  

## The Adapter Binding Properties  
 The following table shows [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] binding properties grouped by category. The category refers to the node under which each binding property appears in the dialog boxes that are presented by different applications to configure the adapter (or binding).

The default is 1 minute.<br /><br /> <strong>Important:</strong> The [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] always uses <strong>OpenTimeout</strong> to set the connection open timeout when it opens a connection to SQL Server. The adapter ignores any timeout (<strong>System.TimeSpan</strong>) parameters passed when you open a communication object. For example, the adapter ignores any timeout parameters passed when opening a channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |    System.TimeSpan    |

Essentially, this means the maximum amount of time the adapter waits for an inbound message. The default is 10 minutes.<br /><br /> <strong>Important:</strong> For inbound operations such as polling, we recommend setting the timeout to the maximum possible value, which is 24.20:31:23.6470000 (24 days). When using the adapter with [!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], setting the timeout to a large value does not impact the functionality of the adapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    System.TimeSpan    |

Set this to <strong>True</strong> to include the database name. Otherwise, set this to <strong>False</strong>. Default is <strong>False</strong>.<br /><br /> This is useful in scenarios where a single application wants to execute operations on identically named artifacts with different metadata in different databases. If there is no database name in the namespace, the generated metadata will conflict. By setting this binding property you can include the database name in the namespace, thereby making them unique.

Set this property to <strong>True</strong> to insert or update values for identity columns. Otherwise set this to <strong>False</strong>. Default is <strong>False</strong>.<br /><br /> <strong>Note:</strong> Setting this property to <strong>True</strong> translates to the adapter using “`SET IDENTITY_INSERT <table_name> ON`”. For more information, see [SET IDENTITY_INSERT (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms188059.aspx). <br /><br /> While using this binding property, you must consider the following points:<br /><br /> - The adapter does not validate the value you are passing for the identity column. For example, if a table has an identity column that has “Identity Seed” set to 100 and “Identity Increment” set to 1, and the adapter client passes a value, say 95, for the identity column, the adapter simply passes on this value to SQL Server.<br /><br /> - Even if you set <strong>AllowIdentityInsert</strong> to <strong>True</strong>, it is not mandatory for an adapter client to specify a value for the identity column in the request message. If a value is present for the identity column, the adapter passes it on to SQL Server. If a value is not present, SQL Server will insert a value based on the specification for the identity column.                                                                                                                                                                  | bool (System.Boolean) |

When the adapter is used with [!INCLUDE [btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the same transaction is used to submit messages from SQL Server to the BizTalk message box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |        string         |
|         <strong>PollWhileDataFound</strong>          |   Polling (Inbound)    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] ignores the polling interval and continuously executes the SQL statement specified for the <strong>PolledDataAvailableStatement</strong> binding property, if data is available in the table being polled. If no data is available in the table, the adapter reverts to execute the SQL statement at the specified polling interval. Default is <strong>false</strong>.<br /><br /> Consider a scenario where the polling interval is set to 60 seconds, and the statement specified for <strong>PolledDataAvailableStatement</strong> returns that data is available for polling. The adapter then executes the statement specified for the <strong>PollingStatement</strong> binding property. Assuming that the adapter takes just 10 seconds to execute the polling statement, it will now have to wait for 50 seconds before executing the <strong>PolledDataAvailableStatement</strong> again, and then subsequently execute the polling statement. Instead, to optimize the performance you can set the <strong>PollWhileDataFound</strong> binding property to <strong>true</strong> so that the adapter can start executing the next polling cycle as soon as the previous polling cycle ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | bool (System.Boolean) |
|        <strong>UseAmbientTransaction</strong>        |      Transaction       | Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] performs the operations using the transactional context provided by the caller. Default is <strong>true</strong>, which means that the adapter always performs the operations in a transactional context. If there are other resources participating in the transaction, and SQL Server also joins the transaction, the transaction gets elevated to an MSDTC transaction.<br /><br /> However, there can be scenarios where you do not want the adapter to perform operations in a transactional context. For example:<br /><br /> - While performing a simple Select operation on a SQL Server database<br /><br /> - While specifying a polling statement that performs a Select operation, and does not involve any changes to the table either through a Delete statement or by invoking a stored procedure.<br /><br /> Both these operations do not make any updates to the database table and, hence, elevating these operations to use an MSDTC transaction can be a performance overhead. In such scenarios, you can set the binding property to <strong>false</strong> so that the [!INCLUDE [adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] does not perform the operations in a transactional context.<br /><br /> <strong>Note:</strong> Not performing operations in a transactional context is advisable only for operations that do not make changes to the database. For operations that update data in the database, we recommend setting the binding property to <strong>true</strong>; otherwise you might either experience message loss or duplicate messages, depending on whether you are performing inbound or outbound operations. | bool (System.Boolean) |

## How Do I Set SQL Server Binding Properties?  
 You can set the SQL Server binding properties when you specify a connection to SQL Server. For information about how to set binding properties when you:  

- Use the [!INCLUDE [consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE [addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)], see [Connect to SQL Server Using Windows Authentication with the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/connect-to-sql-server-using-windows-authentication-with-the-sql-adapter.md).  

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  While using the [!INCLUDE [consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE [addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], if you do not specify a value for a binding property of type string and whose default value is null then that binding property will not be available in the binding file (an XML file) or the app.config file respectively. You must manually add the binding property and its value in the binding file or the app.config file, if required.  

- Configure a send port or receive port (location) in a BizTalk Server solution, see [Manually configure a physical port binding to the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/manually-configure-a-physical-port-binding-to-the-sql-adapter.md).

- Use the WCF channel model in a programming solution, see [Create a Channel using the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/create-a-channel-using-the-sql-adapter.md).  

- Use the WCF service model in a programming solution, see [Configure a Client Binding for the SQL Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-sql-adapter.md).
